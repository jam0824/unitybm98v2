# What is BMSFitness?
It's a fitness game like BOXVR.  
Balls will fly along with the song, so hit it at the right time.  
Also, you can see how many calories you've used.

In this game we use "BMS files".  
A BMS file is a file from a music game that was popular in Japan.  
Many users have made BMSs.  
You can play the game with those files.
